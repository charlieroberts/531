###### Sunday, January 28, 2018


Analysis & review based on Walter Benjamin's essay, [The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/benjamin.htm "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction") and Scott Snibbe's article, [Art Wants to be Ninety-Nine Cents](https://www.snibbe.com/blog/2010/05/19/art99 "Art Wants to be Ninety-Nine Cents")

**Analysis**

Preface:

*I:*

*II:*

*III:*

*IV:*

*V:* Art is valued from the cult perspective, and the other is the economic perspective. For the cult, it was just meant to exist it did not need to be seen. Art has now evolved into forms that lend itself to exhibition (no more cave walls, or mosaics or frescos).

*VI:* Cult value has receeded but it still lives in such things as portraiture. But as the human is removed from the photo, the photo becomes ever more exhibitionary. The viewer is forced to thing with photos by artists like Atget. However at the same time, photos are now being captioned.

*VII:* The seperation of art from the cult resulted in its loss of autonomy. The function of art seemed to alude people ffor the entire ninteenth-century. People quickly asked whether photography was an art, not "has photography transformed art?"

*VIII:* The stage actor presents to the public in person, the screen actor presents to the public via the camera. With the camera, the actor is unable to adjust to the audience. In turn, the audience is able to critique the actor without having any contatct. The audience takes on the position of the camera.

*IX:* The actor must represent himself to the public viewing the camera. By acting just for the cmaera the actor looses part of himself. He is just a projection, he has no aura. The stage actor becomes almost like a prop, picked for his specific qualities, the actor becomes enmeshed with his role. In film, there are numerous seperate preformances. Art has left the realm of the "beatuiful semblance."

*X:* The viewer is able to become somewhat of a self-proclaimed expert. Anybody becomes a writer.

*XI:* The painter distances himself from reality the cameraman pentrates reailty.

*XII:* Reactions of art have shifted from instantanious to progressive. The conventional is enjoyed and goes without criticism, the unconventional is stringently reviewed. Large public viewings ruin painting. 

*XIII:* Films allow a representation of the environment, providing opportunity for deepr analysis that could not be preformed on paintings. And compared to stage acting, films can be isolated and scrutinized. This scientific functionality of of film wil be revolutionary. A different nature is caught by the camera than the one caught by the eye.

*XIV:* One of the foremost roles of art has been to capture that which could only be understood later.

*XV:* The masses define the perception of art. Qantity has replaced quality and people participate as bystandards to the work. Art demands conectration. The concentrated viewer enters the art, he is abosrbed by it. The passive viewer, absorbs the art. Architecture, interestnigly, is art for the mases, and it is the oldest art to date. Tactile appropriation and understanding is achieved by habit. Optical reception is achieved through incidental viewings. New forms of art can no olonger be understood through incidental viewings but rather from habit (tactile appropriation).

*Epilogue:* War is a a rebellion of technology to man. Art for arts sake (Fiat ars â€“ pereat mundus).
